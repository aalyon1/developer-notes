Day 9 of class.

What I learned today:

    - NGRX shortcuts
	- Effects in Redux
	- Add new features to apps
	- Intro to containers:
		- What are they? What problems do they address?
		- How do we create them?
		- Making containers

Notes:

	- If you want something in your app to change after a certain event, then you must add it in the "State” of the app.
    - SwitchMap vs ConcatMap:
	    - SwitchMap is cancellable (api get request can be cancelled)
	        - Any previous requests or outstanding request get rid of them.
            - Only use last request that came in, for safe operations (GET)
	    - ConcatMap is for “unsafe” operations (POST, PUT, DELETE)
